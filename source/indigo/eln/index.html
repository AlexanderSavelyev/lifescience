<p><strong>Professional.  Proven.  Free.</strong></p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>GGA Software Services LLC has received an exclusive license from Pfizer Inc. to create and distribute an open-source version of Pfizer's internal chemistry electronic lab notebook, known as CeN, and Indigo ELN is the resulting open-source version that is available for your use, integration, and customization.<br>
</p>

<p>Benefiting from the considerable investment by Pfizer in its internal chemistry ELN, Indigo ELN provides scientists with a proven way to create, store, retrieve, and share electronic records of chemistry information in ways that meet all legal, regulatory, technical, and scientific requirements.</p>

<p>Indigo ELN allows scientists to prepare, plan, and analyze experiments, access relevant information, and develop new methods in the areas of synthetic chemistry, analytical chemistry, and process chemistry.</p>

<p>Through the use of Indigo ELN, you can upgrade your existing ELN with a proven and tested open-source platform, and you can do it at no charge.<br>
</p>

<p>Indigo ELN combines the best of both worlds: an application developed and refined at Pfizer and tested by thousands of chemists there, and an open-source application that is available at no cost.</p>
