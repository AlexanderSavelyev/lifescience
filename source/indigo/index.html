<h1 id="indigo-toolkit">Indigo Toolkit</h1>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Indigo is a universal organic chemistry toolkit. It contains first-class tools for end users, as well as a documented <a href="api/index.html">API</a> for developers. Indigo it is completely free and open-source, while also available on a commercial basis.</p>

<p>Indigo is based on a cheminformatics library that incorporates a number of <a href="../resources.html#algorithms">unique algorithms</a> developed by GGA, as well as some standard
algorithms well-known in the cheminformatics world. Since the core part of Indigo is written
in modern C++ with no third-party code or dependencies except the ubiquitous zlib and libcairo,
the toolkit provides outstanding performance and excellent portability.</p>

<p>Indigo is used by many corporations and institutions. This includes some Indigo-based commercial tools developed exclusively for our clients. Also, our open-source chemical search engine <a href="../bingo/index.html">Bingo</a> is developed on top of the Indigo library.</p>

<p>Indigo SDK does not make any restrictions for developers. Whatever your favorite platform is&#8212;Java, C#, or Python, not to mention plain C&#8212;you can easily integrate Indigo into your application. All problems you may be afraid of, such as loading binary modules appropriate for the system, or threading issues, or stack overflows, are already solved for you. Also, it is easy to start, as the <a href="api/index.html">interface</a> is very neat. No data types besides the absolute minimum required for it to work. No internal data formats. No painful initialization procedures. </p>

<p>Indigo SDK is highly <a href="api/options.html">configurable</a> and extensible. You can write C/C++/C#/Java/Python plugins for it and distribute them independently.</p>

<p>Indigo has got support from the cheminformatics <a href="../contact.html#feedback-on-open-source-software">community</a>. Any question or comment you have, you can always post it publicly and get a timely reply from the developers' team.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="portability">Portability</h2>

<p>Indigo is written from scratch in portable C++ and supports Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X operating systems.
The rendering is done via <a href="http://cairographics.org/">Cairo</a> vector graphics library. <a href="http://www.zlib.net/">zlib</a> and
<a href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html">libpng</a> are needed for Cairo. <a href="http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml/">tinyxml</a> is used to parse CML files. No other third-party components are used.</p>

<p>Indigo exposes the <a href="api/c.html">C interface</a> to applications. Java and Python
wrappers are available for all of the supported platforms. For Windows, there is also a .NET wrapper.</p>

<p>All of the the code of Indigo is thread-safe, and so its use does not present a problem in multi-threaded applications.</p>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

<p>To understand Indigo's scope, start with the <a href="concepts/index.html">Concepts</a> page.
A quick reference of the API for all supported languages is provided in the
<a href="api/index.html">API</a> page. A separate page deals with the <a href="api/c.html">C interface</a>.
Various options that can be passed to the library are explained on the <a href="api/options.html">Options</a> page.</p>
