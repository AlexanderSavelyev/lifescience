<h2 id="general">General</h2>

<ol>
<li>Please always use the most recent version of Bingo.</li>
<li>Please store as little data as possible in the indexed table. See the &#8220;Performance Notice&#8221; in the <a href="user-manual-oracle.html#storage">user
      manual</a> for details.</li>
<li>Oracle 10 and 11 usually perform better than Oracle 9.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="indexing">Indexing</h2>

<ol>
<li>Please turn off the <code>ARCHIVELOG</code> option in your database instance. This saves a significant amount of time and disk space during indexing.</li>
<li>Bingo takes advantage of multi-core processors. The number of indexing threads is detected
      automatically. If you want, for some reason, to use some specific number of threads, use the <code>NTHREADS</code>
      indexing parameter.</li>
<li>You can disable the computation of specific fingerprint parts (saving both time and disk space) by setting
      the relevant parameter to zero. See the corresponding section of the <a href="user-manual-oracle.html#creating-an-index">user manual</a> for details.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="search">Search</h2>

<ol>
<li>While running search queries, try not to close your SQL session until you really need to close it.
      See the note in the <a href="user-manual-oracle.html#queries">user manual</a> for details.</li>
<li>Please increase Oracle's &#8220;database buffers&#8221; parameter as much as you can, given the extent of server's memory. This step may require activation of <a href="http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14220/memory.htm">manual memory management</a> in Oracle.</li>
