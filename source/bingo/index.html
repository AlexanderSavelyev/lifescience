<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Bingo is a RDBMS data cartridge that provides the industry&#8217;s next-generation, fast, scalable, and efficient
storage and searching solution for chemical information.</p>

<p>Bingo seamlessly integrates the chemistry into Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server and PostgreSQL databases. Its extensible
indexing is designed to enable scientists to store, index, and search chemical moieties alongside numbers and
text within one underlying relational database server.</p>

<p>Bingo sets the industry standard in structure and reaction registration and retrieval. You can register
entities reliably with the confidence that you can retrieve them rapidly.</p>

<p>Because Bingo implements state-of-the-art indexing algorithms within the underlying database server, chemical
searching is fast and reliable. Users can seamlessly combine chemical substructure, reaction, and exact
structure searching with numeric and text SQL terms.</p>

<h2 id="why-select-bingo-as-your-molecular-search-cartridge">Why Select Bingo as Your Molecular Search Cartridge?</h2>

<p>Bingo has all the necessary features required by modern chemoinformatics applications. It also has features
not present in other cartridges &#8212; for example, advanced tautomer search, resonance substructure search, and
fast updating of the index when adding new structures.</p>

<p>Bingo provides an interface for the Oracle cost-based optimizer where possible, particularly in SMILES
queries.</p>

<p>Bingo is reliable. Bingo has no legacy code to maintain, and it has been subjected to extensive testing.</p>

<p>Bingo is fast. We have succeeded in achieving the best performance in the industry for
a search cartridge for both the screening phase and the matching phase of various types of searches, especially
substructure search. Bingo has very effective memory management with no unnecessary reallocations.
Communication with the underlying database, especially LOB handling, is optimized as well. During substructure
searches, molecules and reactions are stored in shared memory to speed up the access.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p><strong>Searches in a variety of ways:</strong>     For molecule structure searching, Bingo supports 2D and 3D exact and
substructure searches, as well as SMARTS searches. It also supports similarity, tautomer, Markush, formula, molecular weight, and flexmatch
searches. Canonical SMILES, with isomeric information included, are available as well.     For reaction
searches, Bingo supports reaction substructure search (RSS) with the optional automatic generation of atom-to-atom
mapping. All of these techniques are available through extensions to the SQL syntax.</p>

<p>A chemistry column in a table being searched can contain Molfile (V2000 or V3000) or SMILES data. Similarly,
the query can be in Molfile or SMILES format. For reactions, Rxnfile or reaction SMILES formats are supported
for both target and query structures.</p>

<p>Fragment highlighting is supported for substructure, tautomer, and reaction substructure searches.</p>

<p>Different indexing options are available to optimize storage space requirements versus the speed of
registration. For example, by switching off the tautomer fingerprints, the indexing will become faster. Indexes can
be updated or rebuilt with no downtime for maintenance. The addition of new molecules/reactions does not
require the rebuilding of the index.</p>

<p><strong>Flexibility and scalability of a true data cartridge:</strong>     Fully compliant with the Oracle and MS SQL Server,
Bingo allows structure and reaction tables to be placed anywhere in the database, and the data can be accessed
by any SQL compliant application.</p>

<p>Bingo contains a combined structure and reaction cartridge. 2D and 3D search features are supported by the
same index.</p>

<p>Bingo supports a large database operation. It is successfully <a href="TODO:bingo-demo">operating</a> on the PubChem database, with up to 27
million structures.</p>

<p>Bingo offers full support for Oracle 9/10/11 and for MS SQL Server 2008. It is written in C++ and is thread-
safe. Native binaries are built for Windows 32/64 bit, Linux 32/64 bit, Mac OS X, and Solaris.</p>

<p>Bingo has a very simple installation procedure. It is possible to install and
use two (or more) versions at the same time.</p>

<p><strong>Integration:</strong>     With Bingo, you can build a fully relational registration system: Insert, delete, and
update records in a relational structure or reaction database using data cartridge technology in Oracle, or
automatically generated triggers in MS SQL Server.</p>

<p>With Bingo, you can develop new applications that manage proprietary structure and reaction information.
Since the cartridge is data model independent, it allows great flexibility in the design of applications and
the management of proprietary structure and reaction information.</p>
