<p>Fingerprinting is a common technique for molecular screening. Daylight, Inc. introduced this technique, and
it is described in the following <a href="http://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.finger.html">article</a>.
Bingo fingerprints, as compared to Daylight fingerprints, are built not from bond paths, but from trees and
rings. A Russian article describes the <a href="http://shmat-razum.blogspot.com/2008/11/blog-%0Apost.html">enumeration of subtrees</a>, which in turn is based on <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.26.4487">reverse
search</a> by David Avis and Komei Fukuda.</p>

<p>For tautomer substructure search, Bingo incorporates a unique type of fingerprinting.</p>

<p>For subgraph matching, we developed an original algorithm. It is somewhat similar to an algorithm by <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1018377">Luigi
Cordella et al.</a></p>

<p>For the molecule layout in Indigo and Bingo, we developed a unique algorithm, based on biconnected components
extraction. It incorporates some ideas of <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ci00038a002">Craig Shelley</a>.</p>

<p>For the aromaticity matching and resonance search, we developed unique algorithms as well.</p>

<p>For the canonical SMILES, Brendan McKay's <a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/nauty/">nauty</a> canonical labeling
algorithm was re-implemented. Many of the original nauty's features and optimizations were not included. There
is also a <a href="http://shmat-razum.blogspot.com/2009/06/graph-automorphisms-canonical-labeling.html">description</a>
of the algorithm in Russian.</p>

<p>For the affine transformation matching, <a href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-%0Abin/paper?S0567739476001873">Wolfgang Kabsch's algorithm</a> was implemented.</p>

<p>In internal molecule and reaction formats, the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Welch">LZW</a> algorithm with some modifications was
used for compression.</p>

<p>For the exact maximum common substructure search, we developed a unique algorithm partially based on <a href="http://cdk.sourcearchive.com/documentation/1:1.0.2-2/dir_fc89e4c1c81ccda6d426c1b67ae622bd.html">Thierry
Hanser's
algorithm</a>
(which in turn has its roots in an algorithm by <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=362367">Coen Bron and Joep
Kerbosh</a>). For the approximate maximum common substructure
search, the <a href="http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110003210164/">2DOM</a> algorithm with some modifications was implemented.
A <a href="assets/mcs_article.pdf">Russian paper</a> describes both algorithms.</p>

<h2 id="oracle-interface">Oracle Interface</h2>

<p>The C++ wrapper was implemented for the Oracle OCI library. One Russian article describes <a href="http://lj.rossia.org/users/ringill/5064.html">the pitfalls of
handling Oracle LOBs in OCI</a>, while another Russian article
covers the <a href="http://shmat-razum.blogspot.com/2009/01/oracle.html">performance of queries</a>.</p>

<h2 id="cairo">Cairo</h2>

<p><a href="http://cairographics.org/">Cairo</a> 1.8.6 was used for rendering in Indigo. In Linux builds, the system-wide
installation of <code>libcairo</code> must be present (<code>-I/usr/include/cairo</code> flag is passed to the compiler and
<code>-lcairo</code> is passed to the linker). In Mac OS X builds, the system-wide installation of <code>libcairo</code> must be
present as well (<code>/opt/local/lib/libcairo.dylib</code> path is passed to the linker). You can install it using
<a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a>. The 32-bit and 64-bit Windows builds of Cairo are included in the source
tree. They can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.gtk.org/download-windows.html">GTK</a> and
<a href="http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win64/dependencies/">GNOME</a> project sites, respectively. Binaries of
<a href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html">libpng</a>, <a href="http://www.zlib.net">zlib</a>,
<a href="http://www.freetype.org">Freetype</a>, <a href="http://www.fontconfig.org">Fontconfig</a>, and
<a href="http://expat.sourceforge.net/">Expat</a>, needed for Cairo, are there as well.</p>
