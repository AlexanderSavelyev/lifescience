<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Ketcher is a web-based chemical structure editor.</p>

<p><a href="TODO:ketcher-demo"><img alt="" src="../assets/ketcher/ketcher_2.png"></a></p>

<p>Since Ketcher is written in pure Javascript, it incorporates high performance,
good portability and light weight. You will not need any Java or Flash plugins
to use it in your browser. Ketcher is completely free and open-source,
while also available on a commercial basis.</p>

<p>You can easily integrate Ketcher into your web application. The process of integration
is very simple and <a href="developers-manual.html">well-documented</a>.</p>

<p>Ketcher is under active development. You can post us your
<a href="../contact.html#feedback-on-open-source-products">comments and suggestions</a> and
get timely replies from the developers' team.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<h3 id="standalone-mode">Standalone mode</h3>

<p>Ketcher supports the standalone mode in which no server support is required. In this mode, SMILES loading, automatic layout and automatic atom-atom mapping are not available. </p>

<h3 id="scalable-vector-graphics-svg-for-rendering">Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) for rendering</h3>

<p>Ketcher uses <a href="http://raphaeljs.com/">Raphael</a> as a backend, which means that <a href="../resources.html#web-standards">SVG</a> or <a href="../resources.html#web-standards">VML</a> (Vector Markup Language) is used for rendering, depending on the browser.</p>

<h3 id="automatic-layout-clean-up-aam-atomtoatom-mapping-and-dearomatization">Automatic layout (clean up), AAM (atom-to-atom mapping) and (de)aromatization</h3>

<p>Ketcher delegates these computationally intensive procedures to the <a href="../indigo/index.html">Indigo</a> toolkit on the server side.</p>

<h3 id="supported-file-formats">Supported file formats</h3>

<p>Ketcher can import and export <a href="../resources.html#file-formats">Molfile/Rxnfile</a>, as well as <a href="../resources.html#file-formats">SMILES</a>. Server is required to import a <a href="../resources.html#file-formats">SMILES</a> string, since layout is needed to obtain the coordinates.</p>

<h3 id="other-features">Other features</h3>

<p><strong>Fast and convenient editing.</strong> We strive to make Ketcher as easy to use and as fast as the state-of-the-art desktop structure editing tools. See <a href="editing-tips.html">Editing Tips</a> for details. Here are some highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lasso and Rectangle selection tools, plus a special Fragment selection tool to deal with connected components, rather than single atoms/bonds.</li>
<li>A variety of <a href="editing-tips.html#hotkeys">hotkeys</a>.</li>
<li>Undo/Redo.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Stereochemistry.</strong> Ketcher provides complete stereochemistry support during the editing, loading, and saving of chemical structures.</p>

<p><strong>Reactions.</strong> Full-featured reaction support including reacting centers, atom flags and AAM. </p>

<p><strong>S-groups.</strong> All major S-group types are supported including generic, SRU polymers, multiple groups, superatoms and data S-groups.</p>

<p><strong>R-groups.</strong> R-site and R-fragment assignment is supported, as well as attachment point specification and R-logic.</p>

<h2 id="supported-browsers">Supported browsers</h2>

<p>The complete functionality of Ketcher has been tested on the following browsers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Internet Explorer 6+</li>
<li>Firefox 3.5+</li>
