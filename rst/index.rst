Open-Source Initiative
======================

| We have extensive experience and expertise in developing organic
chemistry software products for use in pharmaceutical companies,
research institutes, and universities. At the same time, we have been
developing internally a number of cheminformatics tools, and in 2009, we
decided to contribute these tools to the open-source community.
Initially, we created a wholly owned subsidiary called SciTouch LLC for
further developing and distributing these tools.

Since then, we have shifted this open-source initiative from SciTouch to
GGA, and we are continuing to undertake this initiative through GGA
itself.

chemists around the world. We encourage our users to provide us with
feedback, including bug reports and patches, and to
`contact <contact.html>`__ us about the possibility of a commercial
license, if desired.
