We have extensive experience and expertise in developing organic 
chemistry software products for use in pharmaceutical companies,
research institutes, and universities. At the same time, we have been
developing internally a number of cheminformatics tools, and in 2009, we
decided to contribute these tools to the open-source community.
Initially, we created a wholly owned subsidiary called SciTouch LLC for
further developing and distributing these tools.

Since then, this open-source initiative was shifted from SciTouch to 
GGA Software Services LLC, a US-based provider of scientific informatics 
services to global pharmaceutical, scientific instrumentation, medical 
device, scientific publishing and software, and early-stage life science 
companies. In order to strengthen Life Science & Healthcare vertical, 
EPAM Systems in 2014 acquired GGA, and we are continuing to undertake 
this initiative through EPAM.
